## Introduction

### What is AssistedDiscovery?

AssistedDiscovery is an AI-powered tool that helps you understand and document NDC (New Distribution Capability) XML message structures. It:

- **Extracts node structures** from XML files automatically
- **Discovers relationships** between nodes (who references whom)
- **Generates reusable patterns** for future validation
- **Identifies changes** in XML structure over time
- **Validates XML files** against known patterns

### Key Concepts

**Pattern**: A reusable template describing how a specific node type should look (its structure, attributes, children)

**Relationship**: A reference from one node to another (e.g., Passenger ‚Üí Segment)

**Discovery**: The process of analyzing XML structure and generating reusable patterns

**Identify**: The process of comparing XML against known patterns

**Workspace**: An isolated environment for a specific airline or project

### Important: Understanding AI-Powered Analysis

AssistedDiscovery uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to analyze XML structure. This means:

**‚ö†Ô∏è Results May Vary**:
- **LLMs can make mistakes**: Like humans, AI can misinterpret or miss information
- **Non-deterministic**: Running Discovery/Identify on the same XML file multiple times may produce slightly different results
- **Confidence scores matter**: Always review low-confidence matches (< 85%)
- **Human validation required**: Treat results as AI-assisted suggestions, not absolute truth

**Typical Accuracy**:
- **Node extraction**: 90-95% accurate
- **Relationship discovery**: 85-90% accurate
- **Pattern matching**: 90-95% accurate

**Best Practices**:
1. **Always review results**: Don't trust blindly
2. **Validate unexpected discoveries**: AI might find real issues OR make mistakes
3. **Check low-confidence matches**: < 85% confidence needs human verification
4. **Run multiple times if uncertain**: Compare results for consistency
5. **Report issues**: Help improve the system by reporting errors

**We Need Your Feedback!**:
Your feedback helps improve AssistedDiscovery. Please report:
- **False positives**: AI found relationships that don't exist
- **False negatives**: AI missed relationships that do exist
- **Incorrect patterns**: AI generated wrong patterns
- **Inconsistent results**: Different results on same XML
- **Quality issues**: Any accuracy or reliability problems

**How to Report**:
- **Team Contact**: Reach out to nikhilkrishna.lepakshi@amadeus.com
- **Include**: Error message, Run ID, log files, sample XML (if possible)

### Quick Start: Create a Workspace

Before running Discovery, you should create a **workspace** for your project or airline.

**What is a Workspace?**
A workspace is an isolated environment that stores all your data (patterns, runs, configurations) separately. Think of it as a project folder.

**Why use workspaces?**
- ‚úÖ Separate data per airline (LATAM vs United vs Delta)
- ‚úÖ Keep test data separate from production
- ‚úÖ Clean organization and comparison

**How to Create a Workspace:**

1. **Access Config Page**:
   - Click **‚öôÔ∏è Config** in the sidebar

2. **Scroll to Workspace Management**:
   - Find the **üìÅ Workspace Management** section

3. **Add New Workspace**:
   - Enter workspace name in the text box
   - Example names: `WestJet`, `LATAM`, `Testing`, `Production`
   - Use alphanumeric characters only (no spaces)

4. **Click ‚ûï Add Workspace**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Workspace 'WestJet' created successfully!
   ```

5. **Switch to Your Workspace**:
   - At the top of the sidebar, you'll see **Workspace: [dropdown]**
   - Select your newly created workspace
   - All operations now use this workspace

**Example Setup:**
```
Workspaces:
‚îú‚îÄ default       (Built-in, always available)
‚îú‚îÄ WestJet       (For WestJet Airlines)
‚îú‚îÄ LATAM         (For LATAM Airlines)
‚îî‚îÄ Testing       (For experiments)
```

**Important**: Always check which workspace you're in before running Discovery or Identify!

For detailed workspace management, see the [Workspaces](#workspaces) section.

## Core Workflows

AssistedDiscovery has four main workflows:

### 1. Discovery Workflow üîç

**Purpose**: Analyze existing airline XML files to extract and generate reusable patterns

**When to use**:
- Analyzing an existing airline's XML format
- Creating pattern library for known/existing airlines
- Need to understand and document XML structure
- Generating patterns for future validation

**Output**:
- Patterns (reusable templates for node structures)
- Relationships (node references)

**Typical Duration**: 2-5 minutes for standard XML

---

### 2. Identify Workflow üéØ

**Purpose**: Validate XML from new/unknown airlines against saved patterns from existing airlines

**When to use**:
- After Discovery has generated patterns from existing airlines
- Validating new airline XML files against known patterns
- Checking how closely new airline matches existing patterns
- Identifying deviations and differences from standard patterns

**Output**:
- Pattern matches (how closely new XML matches saved patterns)
- Confidence scores
- Deviation reports

**Typical Duration**: 30 seconds for standard XML

---

### 3. Pattern Management üé®

**Purpose**: View, export, and manage discovered patterns

**When to use**:
- Review extracted patterns
- Export patterns for documentation
- Import patterns from another workspace

**Output**:
- Pattern library
- Exportable JSON files

---

### 4. Node Configuration üìã

**Purpose**: Configure which nodes to extract and their expected references

**When to use**:
- Before Discovery

**Output**:
- Node Configuration rules
- Expected reference definitions

---

## Node Configuration

Node Configuration tells AssistedDiscovery **which nodes to extract** and **what references to expect**.

### Why Configure Nodes?

Node configuration is **required** before running Discovery. You must configure which nodes to extract from your XML.

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Controlled Extraction**: Only extract nodes you care about
- ‚úÖ **Better Relationships**: Define expected references between nodes
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Results**: Same extraction rules across runs
- ‚úÖ **Required Step**: Discovery will only extract nodes that are configured and enabled

### Access Node Configuration

1. Click **üìã Node Config** in sidebar
2. You'll see two tabs:
   - **üì§ Analyze XML**: Upload XML to see available nodes
   - **‚öôÔ∏è Manage Configurations**: Create/edit node configs

---

### Tab 1: Analyze XML

**Purpose**: Discover which nodes exist in your XML and configure them using an interactive tree view.

#### Steps:

1. **Upload XML File**:
   - Click **Choose XML file** or drag-and-drop
   - Select your NDC XML file
   - System analyzes the XML structure automatically

2. **Review Detected Information**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Discovered 47 nodes in 19.2/OrderViewRS - Airline: WS

   Spec Version: 19.2
   Airline: WS (WestJet)
   Total Nodes: 47
   Configured: 9
   ```

3. **Understanding Node Selection**:

   The tree view shows your XML structure hierarchically:

   **How Node Selection Works:**
   - **Check a parent node** ‚Üí Extracts that parent + all its descendants
   - **Check a child only** ‚Üí Extracts that child + its descendants (parent NOT extracted)
   - **Check a leaf node** ‚Üí Extracts only that specific node

   Each checked node becomes a "root" for hierarchical extraction. Only explicitly checked nodes are saved.

4. **Select Nodes for Extraction**:

   **Tree View** (Left Panel):
   ```
   üå≥ Node Hierarchy

   ‚ñ∂ IATA_AirShoppingRS
     ‚ñ∂ PayloadAttributes
     ‚ñº Response
       ‚ñº DataLists
         ‚úì DatedMarketingSegmentList
         ‚úì DatedOperatingLegList
         ‚úì DatedOperatingSegmentList
         ‚úì DisclosureList
         ‚úì OriginDestList
   ```

   - Click ‚ñ∂ to expand/collapse nodes
   - Check ‚úì boxes to enable extraction
   - Parent selection auto-enables descendants (shown with ‚úì but not saved individually)

   **Node Properties** (Right Panel):
   ```
   ‚úÖ 9 parent nodes selected for extraction
   üîÅ 82 descendants will be auto-extracted (shown checked in tree)

   Selected nodes for extraction:
   ‚Ä¢ DatedMarketingSegmentList
   ‚Ä¢ DatedOperatingLegList
   ‚Ä¢ DatedOperatingSegmentList
   ... and 6 more
   ```

5. **Save Configuration**:
   - Click **üíæ Save All Configurations**
   - Result:
     ```
     ‚úÖ Saved 47 node configurations!
        ‚Ä¢ 9 parent nodes enabled for extraction
     üí° Configurations saved successfully. Parent nodes will auto-extract
        their descendants during Discovery.
     ```

#### Important Notes:

- **Tree starts collapsed** when you reload - manually expand to see nodes
- **Checkmarks persist** across page reloads
- **Only parent nodes are saved** - descendants are auto-extracted
- **No descendants expanded automatically** - you control the tree view

#### Disabling Nodes:

To **disable** a node that was previously enabled for extraction:

1. **Upload the same XML file** in the Analyze XML tab
2. **Expand the tree** to find the enabled node (shown with ‚úì)
3. **Uncheck the node** by clicking on its checkbox
4. **Click Save All Configurations**

**What happens when you disable a node:**
- The node is marked as `enabled = false` in the database
- The node will **NOT be extracted** during Discovery
- All descendants of that node will also be skipped during extraction
- The configuration remains saved but inactive

**Example:**
```
Before: ‚úì PassengerList (enabled)
After:  ‚òê PassengerList (disabled)
```

When you save, you'll see:
```
‚úÖ Saved 47 node configurations!
   ‚Ä¢ 8 parent nodes enabled for extraction
   ‚Ä¢ 1 parent node disabled (not extracted)
```

**Important**: Disabling a parent node automatically disables all its descendants. They will not be extracted during Discovery, even if they were previously enabled.

#### Re-loading Your Configuration:

When you upload the same XML file later:
- Previously selected nodes will show with checkmarks ‚úì
- Tree remains collapsed for clean view
- Expand any node to see its checked children
- Modify selections as needed and save again

---

### Tab 2: Manage Configurations

**Purpose**: Create and edit node extraction rules.

#### View Existing Configurations

The table shows all configured nodes:

| Section Path | Version | Message | Enabled | Priority | Has Expected Refs |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| PassengerList | 19.2 | OrderViewRS | ‚úì | high | Yes |
| SegmentList | 19.2 | OrderViewRS | ‚úì | high | Yes |

### Common Discovery Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Creating Patterns from Existing Airline

**Situation**: Analyzing an existing airline's XML to create reusable patterns.

**Steps**:
1. Create new workspace: `Airline_Code` (e.g., `WestJet`)
2. Configure nodes in Node Config (select which nodes to extract)
3. Upload existing airline XML file
4. Run Discovery
5. Review generated patterns and relationships

**Result**: Pattern library created for this existing airline, ready for future Identify operations with new airlines.

---

#### Scenario 2: Updating Existing Patterns

**Situation**: Existing airline's XML structure has changed, need to update patterns.

**Steps**:
1. Use the existing workspace for that airline (e.g., `WestJet`)
2. Upload updated XML file with new structure
3. Run Discovery
4. Compare:
   - New relationships discovered = structural additions
   - Missing expected references = structural changes

**Result**: Updated pattern library reflecting new structure.

---

#### Scenario 3: Validating New Airline (Use Identify Instead)

**Situation**: New airline XML needs validation against existing patterns.

**Action**: Use **Identify Workflow** instead of Discovery.

**Steps**:
1. Use workspace containing patterns from existing airlines
2. Upload new airline's XML file
3. Run **Identify** (not Discovery)
4. Review pattern matches to see how closely new airline matches existing patterns

**Result**: Compatibility report showing how well new airline conforms to known patterns.

## Identify Workflow

Identify validates new XML files against existing patterns.

### When to Use Identify

**For New/Unknown Airlines**:
- You've run Discovery on existing airlines and generated patterns
- Now you want to validate new airline XML files against those patterns

**Use Cases**:
- New Airline Validation: Check how closely a new airline's XML matches existing patterns
- Compliance Testing: Verify new airline follows standard structures
- Deviation Detection: Identify differences from known patterns
- Onboarding: Assess compatibility of new airline XML with existing systems

### Prerequisites

‚úÖ **Patterns must exist** in workspace (from Discovery)
‚úÖ **Patterns must match XML type** (same message_root)

### Step-by-Step: Running Identify

#### Step 1: Access Identify Page

Click **üéØ Identify** in sidebar

#### Step 2: Select Workspace

```
Workspace: [Dropdown]
```

Same workspace where you ran Discovery.

#### Step 3: Upload XML File

- Upload the XML file you want to validate
- Must be same message type as patterns (e.g., OrderViewRS)

**Version Compatibility**:
- ‚úÖ Same version as patterns: Full validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Different version: Partial validation (structure may differ)

#### Step 4: Start Identify

Click **üîç Start Identify**

**What Happens**:

1. **Extract Node Structures** (1-2 minutes)
   - Same extraction as Discovery
   - Analyzes relationships between nodes
   - No pattern generation

2. **Match Against Patterns** (30 seconds)
   - Compare each extracted node to existing patterns
   - Compare relationships against expected patterns
   - Calculate similarity scores
   - Classify matches

3. **Generate Report** (instant)

ü§ñ AI Analysis

The Passenger node in this XML file is structurally similar to the
known pattern, with 89% confidence. The main differences are:

1. Additional Field: 'MiddleName' is present but was marked optional
   in the pattern. This is acceptable and common for middle name variations.

2. All required fields are present: PaxID, GivenName, Surname match
   the pattern requirements exactly.

3. References are valid: Both SegmentRefID and FareRefID correctly
   point to existing nodes in the XML.

Recommendation: This is a HIGH_MATCH and acceptable variation. No
action needed unless 'MiddleName' should be mandatory.

### Identify Workflow Tips

**Best Practices**:

1. **Run Discovery First**: Always have patterns before Identify
2. **Same Message Type**: Identify OrderViewRS against OrderViewRS patterns
3. **Review NEW_PATTERN**: These may indicate structure changes
4. **Investigate NO_MATCH**: Could be data quality issues

**Common Issues**:

**"No pattern matches found"**:
- Cause: No patterns exist for this message type
- Solution: Run Discovery first to generate patterns

**Low confidence scores**:
- Cause: XML structure changed since Discovery
- Solution: Review differences, possibly re-run Discovery

## Workspaces

Workspaces isolate data per airline or project. For basic workspace creation, see [Quick Start: Create a Workspace](#quick-start-create-a-workspace) in the Getting Started section. For detailed management, see [Managing Workspaces](#managing-workspaces) in the Configuration section.

### What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** is an isolated environment containing:
- Patterns
- Relationships
- Node Configurations
- Discovery/Identify runs

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Separation**: LATAM data separate from United data
- ‚úÖ **Organization**: One workspace per project
- ‚úÖ **Clean Comparison**: Compare airlines side-by-side

```
‚ùå Failed to analyze XML structure
**Error:** [Technical error message from backend]

üí° Troubleshooting:
- Check if the XML file is well-formed and valid
- Verify it's a supported message type (e.g., AirShoppingRS)
- Check the log files for detailed error information:

üìÇ Log File (macOS):
~/Library/Logs/AssistedDiscovery/assisted_discovery.log
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Validate XML Format**:
   - Open XML in text editor
   - Check for:
     - Unclosed tags
     - Special characters (&, <, >)
     - Encoding issues
     - Malformed structure
   - Use online XML validator: https://www.xmlvalidation.com/

2. **Check File Type**:
   - Must be NDC XML message (AirShoppingRS, OrderViewRS, etc.)
   - Not just any XML file
   - Should have NDC namespace declarations

3. **Review Log File**:
   - Go to **‚öôÔ∏è Config** ‚Üí **üìã Application Logs**
   - Click **üìÇ Open Log Folder**
   - Search for error timestamp in `assisted_discovery.log`
   - Look for detailed Python stack trace

4. **Try Different XML**:

### Discovery/Identify Issues

#### "No patterns extracted"

**Causes**:
- XML file empty or corrupted
- LLM not configured
- XML format not supported
- No nodes configured for extraction

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify XML File**:
   - Open in text editor
   - Check it's valid XML
   - Ensure it's NDC format (not random XML)

2. **Check LLM**:
   - Test LLM connection in Config
   - Check logs for LLM errors

3. **Check Node Configurations**:
   - If configured, ensure nodes are "Enabled"
   - Try disabling configs to allow auto-detection

---

#### "No patterns found" when running Identify

**Cause**: No patterns exist for this message type/version

**Solution**: Run Discovery first to generate patterns

**Example**:
```
Patterns in workspace: 19.2/OrderViewRS
Your XML: 21.3/AirShoppingRS

‚ùå Mismatch: Different message types
```

**Fix**: Either:
- Run Discovery on AirShoppingRS to create patterns
- Use OrderViewRS file for Identify

---

#### "Relationship analysis failed"

**Causes**:
- LLM timeout
- Invalid XML snippets
- Network interruption

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error
2. **Retry**: Re-run Discovery
3. **Smaller XML**: Try with smaller sample file first
4. **Increase Timeout**: Contact administrator if persistent

---

### UI Issues

#### "Backend connection failed"

**Causes**:
- Backend not running
- Wrong port
- Firewall blocking

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Backend Status**:
   ```bash
   # Check if backend is running
   curl http://localhost:8000/health

   # Expected response:
   {"status": "healthy"}
   ```

2. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   # Portable distribution
   ./start_app.sh

   # Development
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

3. **Check Port**:
   - Backend should be on port 8000
   - Frontend should be on port 8501
   - Ensure no conflicts

---

#### Page not loading or spinning forever

**Causes**:
- Backend slow response
- Large data set
- Browser cache

**Solutions**:

1. **Wait**: Discovery/Identify can take 3-5 minutes
2. **Check Logs**: Backend logs show progress
3. **Refresh**: Ctrl+F5 (hard refresh)
4. **Clear Cache**: Browser ‚Üí Clear cache and cookies

---

### Data Issues

#### "Workspace not found" after switching

**Cause**: Workspace database not created yet

**Solution**: Create workspace first in Config page

---

#### "Patterns still show after deletion"

**Cause**: Frontend cache

**Solution**: Refresh page (F5 or Ctrl+R)

---

### Performance Issues

#### Discovery is very slow (>10 minutes)

**Causes**:
- Large XML file (>10MB)
- Many node types (>50)
- Slow LLM API responses

**Solutions**:

1. **Configure Nodes**: Only extract important nodes
2. **Smaller Sample**: Use smaller XML file for initial Discovery
3. **Check Logs**: See which step is slow

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use AssistedDiscovery offline?**
A: No, it requires internet connection for LLM API calls (Azure OpenAI or Gemini).

**Q: Can multiple users share workspaces?**
A: Not directly. Export/import patterns to share data between users. In the future, a centralised database will be used to share data between users.

**Q: Can I modify extracted patterns?**
A: Run Discovery again with refined configuration.

**Q: How accurate is relationship discovery?**
A: LLM-based discovery has ~85-95% accuracy. Always validate unexpected discoveries and review confidence scores.

**Q: Why do I get different results when running Discovery twice on the same XML?**
A: AssistedDiscovery uses AI (LLMs) which are non-deterministic. Each run may produce slightly different results due to:
- Random sampling in AI models
- Different interpretation of ambiguous structures
- Temperature settings (we use low temperature for consistency, but not zero)

**Recommendation**: If results vary significantly:
- Check confidence scores - trust high confidence (>90%) more
- Run multiple times and look for consistent patterns
- Review differences manually
- Report significant inconsistencies to help improve the system

**Q: Can LLMs make mistakes?**
A: Yes, absolutely. LLMs can:
- Miss relationships that exist
- Find relationships that don't exist
- Misinterpret node structures
- Generate incorrect patterns

**Always review results**, especially:
- Low confidence matches (< 85%)
- Unexpected discoveries
- Broken relationships
- New patterns

Think of AssistedDiscovery as an **intelligent assistant**, not a perfect oracle. Human validation is essential.

**Q: How can I improve accuracy?**
A: Several ways:
1. **Configure expected references** in Node Configuration before Discovery
2. **Use representative XML samples** (not edge cases)
3. **Review and validate** all unexpected discoveries
4. **Run multiple times** and compare for consistency
5. **Provide feedback** when AI makes mistakes
6. **Use clear, well-formed XML** files

**Q: What should I do if I find an error in the results?**
A: Please report it! Your feedback helps improve the system:
1. Note the Run ID from the results page
2. Save the error details and confidence scores
3. Export relevant patterns/results
4. Include log files if possible
