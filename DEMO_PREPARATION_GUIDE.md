**Steps:**
1. **Click "🔬 Discovery" in sidebar**

2. **Upload XML File**
   - Drag and drop or browse
   - Show auto-detection:
     - ✅ Message Type: OrderViewRS
     - ✅ NDC Version: 19.2
     - ✅ Airline Code: (if present)

3. **Click "🚀 Start Discovery"**
   - Show progress indicator
   - Explain: "The AI is extracting node structures, finding relationships, and generating reusable patterns"

4. **Show Results** (After completion)

   **NodeFacts Tab:**
   - "These are all the XML nodes we extracted with their structure"
   - Point out: Node Type, Attributes, Children
   - Filter by section to show organization

   **Relationships Tab:**
   - **KEY DEMO POINT**: "This is unique - AI discovered WHO REFERENCES WHOM"
   - Show Expected Validated ✅ (known references that work)
   - Show Unexpected Discovered 🔍 (new relationships AI found)
   - Explain: "This helps us understand data flow in the XML"

   **Patterns Tab:**
   - "These are reusable templates generated from this analysis"
   - Click on a pattern to show decision rule
   - Explain: "These patterns can now validate future XML files"

**Key Talking Points:**
- ✨ Fully automated - no manual template writing
- 🧠 AI understands structure AND relationships

## 🎯 EXPECTED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Technical Questions

**Q: What LLM do you use?**
**A:** "We support Azure OpenAI GPT-4o and Google Gemini. Both are configurable. Azure OpenAI is recommended for enterprise due to data residency guarantees."

**Q: How accurate is the pattern matching?**
**A:** "We use a weighted 4-factor similarity algorithm:
- Node type match: 30%
- Must-have attributes: 30%
- Child structure: 25%
- Reference patterns: 15%

Initial testing shows 95%+ accuracy for EXACT_MATCH verdicts. We tune thresholds per NDC version."

**Q: What about performance?**
**A:**
- Discovery: 2-5 minutes for typical OrderViewRS XML
- Identify: 30 seconds (much faster)
- Memory: <2GB during processing
- Supports XML files up to 10MB+

**Q: How do you handle PII?**
**A:** "Built-in PII masking engine detects and masks:
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Credit cards
- Passport numbers
- 11 pattern types total

PII is masked BEFORE sending to LLM or storing in database."

**Q: What NDC versions are supported?**
**A:** "All NDC versions from 17.2 onwards (17.2, 18.1, 19.2, 21.3). The system is version-agnostic - it auto-detects from XML namespaces."

**Q: Can we customize the extraction?**
**A:** "Yes! Node Manager allows BAs to:
1. Select which nodes to extract
2. Define expected references
3. Configure extraction rules
4. Copy configs across versions"

---

### Business Questions

**Q: What's the ROI?**
**A:** "Current manual XML analysis takes:
- 2-4 hours per airline integration
- Prone to human error
- Requires XML expertise

AssistedDiscovery:
- 5 minutes automated analysis
- Consistent, repeatable
- Self-documenting patterns
- Reduces integration time by 80%"

**Q: Who uses this?**
**A:** "Three user personas:
1. **Business Analysts**: Configure nodes, review relationships
2. **Integration Engineers**: Run Discovery/Identify, debug issues
3. **QA Teams**: Validate XML changes during testing"

**Q: What if the AI makes a mistake?**
**A:** "Hybrid approach:
1. AI proposes patterns and relationships
2. BA reviews and configures expectations
3. System validates AI findings against BA rules
4. Flagged deviations for human review

It's AI-assisted, not AI-automated. Human stays in the loop."

**Q: Can we integrate this with our CI/CD pipeline?**
**A:** "Yes! REST API available (http://localhost:8000/docs):
- POST /runs/discovery - Trigger discovery
- POST /runs/identify - Trigger validation
- GET /patterns - Retrieve patterns
- All endpoints return JSON

Can be integrated into Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc."

**Q: What about data security?**
**A:**
- Workspace isolation prevents data leakage
- PII masking before LLM processing
- Azure OpenAI offers data residency
- No data stored in LLM (stateless calls)
- All data in local MySQL database

---

### Competitive Questions

**Q: Can't we just use ChatGPT directly?**
**A:** "Generic LLMs require:
- Manual prompt engineering per XML
- No pattern storage/reuse
- No relationship discovery
- No validation workflow
- No version management

AssistedDiscovery is purpose-built for NDC XML with:
- Automated pattern generation
- Relationship discovery engine
- Pattern library with versioning
- Validation workflow
- Multi-workspace support"

**Q: What about existing XML validation tools?**
**A:** "Traditional tools (XMLSPY, Altova):
- ✅ Good for XSD schema validation
- ❌ Don't discover relationships
- ❌ Don't adapt to airline variations
- ❌ No AI-powered insights
- ❌ Manual template creation

AssistedDiscovery complements XSD validation by adding intelligent structure analysis and relationship discovery."
