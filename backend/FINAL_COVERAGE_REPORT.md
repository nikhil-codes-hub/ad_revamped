## Integration Test Analysis

### Integration Tests Status

**Total**: 42 integration tests
**Passing**: 6 (14%)
**Failing**: 19 (45%)
**Errors**: 17 (41%)

### Why Integration Tests Fail

#### 1. BigInteger Auto-Increment (17 errors)

**Issue**: SQLite doesn't auto-generate BigInteger IDs for Pattern, NodeFact, NodeConfiguration models

**Affected Tests**:
- `test_api_discovery.py`: 1 error (node_facts creation)
- `test_api_identify.py`: 4 errors (patterns creation)
- `test_api_node_configs.py`: 7 errors (node_configurations creation)
- `test_api_patterns.py`: 5 errors (patterns creation)

**Solution**: Would need MySQL testcontainers or manual ID assignment

#### 2. Wrong API Endpoints (19 failures)

**Issue**: Tests call endpoints that return 404 or have wrong method signatures

**Examples**:
```python
# Test expects these endpoints:
POST /api/v1/discovery/upload        # Returns 404
GET  /api/v1/discovery/runs/{id}     # Returns 404
POST /api/v1/identify                # Returns 404
GET  /api/v1/node-configs            # Wrong response structure

# Actual endpoints may be different or not implemented
```

**Affected Tests**:
- Discovery API: 6 failures (404 errors, wrong endpoints)
- Identify API: 6 failures (404 errors, wrong endpoints)
- Node Configs API: 5 failures (wrong field names, 422 errors)
- Patterns API: 2 failures (wrong response structure)

#### 3. Model Field Mismatches (3 failures)

**Issue**: Tests use fields that don't exist in models

**Examples**:
```python
# Test tries to create:
Run(workspace="default")  # workspace field doesn't exist

NodeConfiguration(
    path_local="...",     # path_local field doesn't exist
    is_enabled=True       # should be 'enabled'
)
```

## Recommendations by Priority

### Priority 1: Fix Integration Tests (15-20 hours)

**High Impact - Gets to 60-65% coverage**

1. **Skip BigInteger integration tests** (2 hours)
   - Add `@pytest.mark.skip` to 17 tests
   - Reason: Same SQLite limitation as unit tests

2. **Fix API endpoint URLs** (8 hours)
   - Map actual FastAPI routes
   - Update test URLs
   - Fix request/response formats
   - **Impact**: 19 tests → passing

3. **Fix model field names** (2 hours)
   - Remove `workspace` from Run creation
   - Update NodeConfiguration field names
   - **Impact**: 3 tests → passing

**Expected Result**: 88 passing tests, 65% coverage

### Priority 2: Mock LLM Services (10 hours)

**Medium Impact - Gets to 70-75% coverage**

1. **Mock OpenAI/Anthropic calls** (6 hours)
   - Mock llm_extractor
   - Mock template_extractor
   - Test response handling

2. **Add workflow integration tests** (4 hours)
   - Test discovery_workflow with mocked LLM
   - Test identify_workflow with mocked LLM

**Expected Result**: 100+ passing tests, 75% coverage

### Priority 3: MySQL Testcontainers (8 hours)

**High Effort - Enables all model tests**
