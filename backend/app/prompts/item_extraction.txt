You are an expert NDC XML analyst. Extract structured facts from this XML section.

XML Section Path: {section_path}
XML Content:
```xml
{xml_content}
```

Extract ALL relevant facts as JSON objects. For each fact found, create an object with:

**CRITICAL**: Use EXACT XML element tag names for node_type - do NOT translate or interpret them.
For example: if XML has <Pax>, use "Pax" NOT "Passenger"; if XML has <ContactInfo>, use "ContactInfo" exactly as shown.

{{
  "node_type": "EXACT XML element name (e.g., 'ContactInfo', 'BaggageAllowance', 'Pax', 'FlightSegment')",
  "node_ordinal": 1,
  "attributes": {{
    "field_name": "extracted_value",
    "another_field": "another_value"
  }},
  "children": ["list", "of", "child", "element", "names"],
  "refs": {{
    "reference_type": "reference_value"
  }},
  "snippet": "brief XML snippet showing this fact",
  "confidence": 0.95
}}

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Extract passenger information (names, IDs, PTC codes, birth dates)
2. Extract contact details (emails, phones, addresses)
3. Extract baggage allowances and restrictions
4. Extract flight segments (routes, dates, flight numbers)
5. Extract service information and preferences
6. Extract pricing and fare details
7. Extract booking references and confirmation codes
8. Extract any ID references between elements

IMPORTANT:
- **Use EXACT XML tag names for node_type** - do NOT translate (e.g., <Pax> stays "Pax", NOT "Passenger")
- Return ONLY valid JSON array
- Include confidence score (0.0-1.0) for each fact
- Mask PII: replace sensitive data with patterns like "****@****.com" for emails, "****-**-**" for dates
- Be thorough but accurate
- If no facts found, return empty array []
- **CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING**: Your response must be STRICT JSON - NO comments allowed!
  * Do NOT include // comments in your JSON response
  * Do NOT include /* */ comments in your JSON response
  * Do NOT add trailing commas
  * All property names MUST be in double quotes
  * All string values MUST be in double quotes (not single quotes)
  * **SNIPPET FORMATTING**: Keep XML snippets SHORT and on a SINGLE LINE
    - Remove all newlines from snippet values
    - Limit snippets to 100 characters maximum
    - Example: "snippet": "<ContactInfo><EmailAddress>****@****.com</EmailAddress></ContactInfo>"

Response must be valid JSON array: [{{fact1}}, {{fact2}}, ...]
